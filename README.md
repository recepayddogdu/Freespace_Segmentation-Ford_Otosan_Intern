# Freespace Segmentation with Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN)
Drivable area detection in highway images with semantic segmentation.

The project was developed with technologies such as **Python**, **Pytorch**, **opencv**.

Below are the image used while testing the model, the expected output from the model, and the drivable fields that the model predicts;
